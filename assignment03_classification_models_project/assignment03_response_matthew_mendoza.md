# Matthew Mendoza - Assignment 03: Understanding Real-Life Data Concerns

> 1. Please analyze what aspects of the event you will collect data about,
>    from outreach to parking; performers to speech givers; stage to sound?

On the day of the event I brought my camera to capture the acts and performances
featured. It can be said that I essentially captured data on how intense the light
was throughout the event given the camera's light meter and adjustment of the
camera's shutter-speed, sensor sensitivity (ISO), and aperture settings.

> 2. What are the potential missing attributes that are not easy to detect,
>    about the event, that data collectors may miss collecting?
>    Identify discreet attributes that can make a huge difference in analysis
>    or machine learning like the 2016 election example,
>    if such a data attribute is not collected.

Undetectable potential discrepancies may involve individuals (like me) who were
erroneously issued parking tickets despite event promotion materials specifying
"Free event parking at PS3 (Parking Structure 3) on floors 4, 5, and 6."
Some recipients of these tickets opted to bear the approximately $75 parking
cost rather than challenging the citation, as the University Transportation &
Parking Services (UTAPS) proved unhelpful, and their appeal tool was
nonfunctional on mobile.

> 3. What kind of unstructured data will you use about the event,
>    to extract structured data that can be made good use of in data analysis?
>    Unstructured data is data that you cannot easily represent with a data table.

I can use photos and videos as the source of my unstructured data. I then can
structure the data by implementing image recognition algorithms to identify
people, objects, or scenes; and, extract metadata such as timestamp, location,
and camera settings.
