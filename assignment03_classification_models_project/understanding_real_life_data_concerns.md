Dear students,

For those who attended the Sac State WCF please submit your observations for a
1% extra credit. For those who did not or could not attend too, it is alright,
you can refer to or make up a real-life scenario for any experience you have
had and cover the same questions below applied to your context.

Focus on this interesting project and submit after the event:

1. Please analyze what aspects of the event you will collect data about, from
   outreach to parking; performers to speech givers; stage to sound?

2. What are the potential missing attributes that are not easy to detect,
   about the event, that data collectors may miss collecting?Â  Identify discreet
   attributes that can make a huge difference in analysis or machine learning like
   the 2016 election example, if such a data attribute is not collected.

3. What kind of unstructured data will you use about the event, to extract
   structured data that can be made good use of in data analysis? Unstructured
   data is data that you cannot easily represent with a data table.

If you are uploading a file, please upload a PDF file.

Best wishes and cheers,

:)
