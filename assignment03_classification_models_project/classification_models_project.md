- Submitting a file upload
- Available Sep 30 at 12am - Nov 30 at 11:59pm

Dear students,

Please find details of the classification models project.
The location for the dataset, data set description file and the project instructions are in:

Files --> Help --> Labs --> data --> Project3_Classification_Models

You may have already started using help from Tutorial_6 in Labs on the dataset
you used in the previous project(s). However, in addition, please follow the
instructions on the dataset provided for this project. You may use help from Tutorial_6.
The more datasets you gain experience with, the deeper your insights are as each dataset is unique.

\*\*\* This tutorial Tutorial_6 has examples for all Classification Models.
Hence get started with Decision Trees and then keep doing other models one at a time.
Submit after all classification models are taught. \*\*\*

Please create a one or two page report summarizing the key approaches, decisions and findings.

**The Rubric is as follows**:

(It is important to have insights in differences between different datasets)

1. Running classification models we learned using help from Tutorial_6 on your dataset: 10%
2. Feature selection and Data splitting on the provided dataset: 25%
3. Running the classification models on the provided dataset: 25%
4. Performing accuracy analysis and comparing the models on the provided dataset: 25%
5. Any Visuals: 5%
6. Report: 10%

Cheers,

:)
